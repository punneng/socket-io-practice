## Homework
Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- Add support for nicknames
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- Show who’s online
- Add private messaging
- Share your improvements!

No any fancy ui, just text commands
``` 
@command setNickname neng
@command getClients
@command sendMessageTo neng whatever messages want to send
```

```
npm install
npm run test
npm run start
```
and visite at http://localhost:3000/
